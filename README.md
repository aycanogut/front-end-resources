# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This project intends to collect all the resources related to web development (mostly front-end) and design in one place.

## Website

This website is built using [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/), a documentation framework.

### Installation

```
$ pnpm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Contributing
